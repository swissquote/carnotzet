## [1.7.4] - 2018-05-18

### Added

- Added a utility method to expose the maven dependency tree to extensions so that they can leverage the hierarchy.

- Fixed a bug in the selection of configuration variants, the one closer to the root module is now selected.

## [1.7.3] - 2018-03-21

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug introduced in 1.7.2 on some platform not supporting unicode characters everywhere

## [1.7.2] - 2018-03-20

### Added

- Added a utility class to simplify the creation of container startup wrapper scripts in extensions

### Changed

### fixed

- Fix IOException when merging into non-existing file

## [1.5.1] - 2017-12-07

  unchanged (fail).

### Added

- Support for image pulling policies in docker-compose runtime

- Support for extra entries in /etc/hosts in containers, use the extra.hosts property in carnotzet.properties

### Fixed

- Ignore MAVEN_DEBUG_OPTS when invoking maven to resolve dependencies, this allows to debug (with suspend=y)
  without the sub-maven process also suspending.
- Custom network aliases are now properly exported as dnsdock aliases.

## [1.2.3] - 2017-09-21

## [1.2.1] - 2017-08-03

### Fixed

- Fixed "welcome" page generation regression introduced in 1.2.0

## [1.2.0] - 2017-07-17
